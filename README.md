# Portfolio

## Description:
This is part of code that I use for my [portfolio](https://juto.dk).
When deploying, I minify just about everything, including the html.

I've stripped the serverside email validation.

The portfolio have been built using Bootstrap, and some code from the [freelancer](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer) template.


Made with :heart: in Aalborg, Denmark
